CP_TFMS_vs_random
CP_TFMS_vs_random_SE_enrichment
	cluster potential comparing
	- TFMS and 
	- same number of randomly selected genomic position (follow exponential distribution)
	get p-value for each TFMS using exponential distribution as control
	
	Then check enrichment at SE for those TFMS with p-value 0.05/0.01
	- for each SE in 86 cell types, and 
	- for union SE


CP_TFBS_NOT_overlap_motif_vs_TFMS
CP_TFBS_overlap_motif_vs_TFMS
CP_TFBS_vs_TFMS
	cluster potential and enrichment at cell-type matched SEs comparing
	- TFBS, with or without motif 
	- same number of randomly selected TFMS (bedtools closest w/ -D ref -fd re-calculated)
