Super-Enhancers in the Control of Cell Identity and Disease
https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2013.09.053

All analyses were performed using RefSeq (GRCh37/hg19) human gene annotations or
RefSeq (NCBI37/mm9) mouse gene annotations

Table S2. Catalog of Super-Enhancers, Typical Enhancers, and Associated Genes in
86 Human Samples, Related to Figures 3, 4, and 6. The tables containing the
super-enhancers and super-enhancer-associated genes are found in Data 1. The
catalog highlights the cell and tissue types. Representative data sets (Rep.
Dataset) were used in Figures 3A, 3B, 3C, S3B, and S3C. Data sets used for SNP
analyses were included for Figures 4B, 5, and S4C. Cancer ID identifies the
samples included on Figures 6A and S5. Additional column indicates whether the
sample was used for analyses on Figures 6Bâ€“6E. CML stands for chronic
myelogenous leukemia.


Data S1. Super-Enhancers, Typical Enhancers, and Their Associated Genes in 86
Human Cell and Tissue Samples, Related to Figures 3, 4, 5, 6, S3, S4, and S5.
Zip file containing 86 files, each containing stitched enhancers, associated
genes, and ChIP-seq signal. Columns are: enhancer ID, chromosome, start, end,
associated gene, enhancer rank, is enhancer a super-enhancer (1:yes, 0:no),
H3K27ac ChIP-seq density (rpm/bp), read density in corresponding input sample
(rpm/bp).
