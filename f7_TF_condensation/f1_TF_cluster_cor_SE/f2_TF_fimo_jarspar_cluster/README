f1_bedtools_closest
	for each TF and for each motif site
	find the distance to its closest site 
	
f2_closest_distribution
	plot the distribution of distance to closest site
	random distribute same number of sites in the genome as control

f3_closest_distribution_stats
	t-test comparing true vs. control 
	to check if TF has more site close to each other

f4_stats_figs
	plot the t-statistics from t-test
	plot the distribution of distance (bp) at which TF has OR>2 than control
	
f5_motif_within_300bp
	keep only those motif has a neighbor <300bp
	
f6_bedtools_merge
	merge all regions allowing a gap of 300bp
