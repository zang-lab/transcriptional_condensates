f1_CTCF_cluster
	check the distribution of distance to the nearest/closest sites from
	- ctcf union peaks
	- ctcf motif
	
	
f2_TF_fimo_jarspar_cluster
	for each TF and the motif file
	check the distribution of distance to the nearest/closest sites 
	with randomly distributed same number of sites as control	


archive/f3_TF_seqpos_cistrome_cluster
	the cistrome data has adjacent motif/sites for all TF


f4_cluster_enrichment_at_SE
	for SE from cancer or ESC
	check if those TF motifs w/ a neighbor <300bp are enriched at SE
