f1_TF_cluster_cor_SE  
	Cluster of TFs, use CTCF as an model to define TF cluster
	Check if TF clusters ~ SE in cancers or ESC
	any pattern correlations between TF cluster and SE?
	
	
f2_TF_IDR_SE_mutation  
	Any tools to find/predict IDR from TF sequence/proteins?
	Check IDR score in Tingting Li's paper
	Find IDR protein and check if IDR protein tend to enriched at SE
	Check TCGA data, find mutations at IDR region


f3_chromatin_IDR_by_TFBS  
	Assign IDR to TFBS, use any model to sum the IDR score  
	if mutation at TF gene affect sequence/chromatin IDR potential


fx_DL_NLP_on_chromatin_IDR
	If DL NLP model in NM paper help?
