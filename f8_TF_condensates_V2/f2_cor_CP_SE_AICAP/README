f1_TFMS_CP_cor_length_number
	How is the CP correlated with motif/peak length/numbers


f2_TFBS_CP_cor_TFMS_CP
f3_sameCT_CP_cor_SE
f4_sameCT_cor_AICAP_sep_by_CP_SE
f5_sameTF_CP_cor_SE

	1. Correlation among
	- TF cluster potential of TFMS and TFBS
	- TF protein AICAP score
	- TF enrichment at SEs

    2. for TFs and celltypes with multiple datasets, CP/SE were averaged across all data
