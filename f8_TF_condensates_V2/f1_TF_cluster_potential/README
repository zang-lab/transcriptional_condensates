get the closest neighbor for CP analysis for 
- all ChIP-seq peaks 
- motif overlapped peaks
- motif non-overlapped peaks

f2_TFMS_TFBS_CP

CP of TFMS, using randomly generated regions as control
CP of TFBS, using TFMS as control
- to check if TF CP changed compared to TFMS
- and how is this correlated with enrichment at SE

determine the clustered TFMS/TFBS?
