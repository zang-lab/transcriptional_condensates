==
f1_TF_cluster_potential
==
cluster potential (CP) of 
- TF motif sites (TFMS) vs random genomic loci
- ChIP-seq TF binding sites (TFBS) with motif
- TFBS without motif
and enrichment at SE comparing TFBS and TFMS

==
f2_cor_CP_SE_AICAP

- ATAC-seq signals at SEs with cancer-specific TFs  



==
fz_combined_features
==
