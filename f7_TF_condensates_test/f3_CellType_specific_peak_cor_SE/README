f1_cellType_Factor_data_Count
	for each cell type and each TF/HM, check the number of ChIP-seq data in Cistrome DB
	PeaksFoldChangeAbove10 > 500
	
f2_selected_data

f3_union_peaks_across_cellTypes
f4_cellType_specific_peaks
	For each cell type and each factor, keep one ChIP-seq data with most peaks. 
	Union all peaks and get cell type specific peaks


f5_cellType_specific_peaks_cor_SE_over_AllPeaks
f6_stats_heatmap
	check the enrichment of cell type specific peaks at SEs
	with cell type all peaks as bg control
