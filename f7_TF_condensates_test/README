-- Hypothesis test --
TF clusters/condensates are associated with SE


f1_TF_motif_cluster_cor_SE  
	-- Motif data
	Cluster of TFs, use CTCF as an model to define TF cluster
	Check if TF clusters ~ SE in cancers or ESC
	any pattern correlations between TF cluster and SE?
	
	
f2_TF_motif_IDR_SE_mutation  
	-- Motif data
	Any tools to find/predict IDR from TF sequence/proteins?
	Check IDR/AICAP score in Tingting Li's paper
	Find IDR protein and check if IDR protein tend to enriched at SE
	# Check TCGA data, find mutations at IDR region

	
f3_CellType_specific_peak_cor_SE
	-- ChIP-seq peak from Cistrome DB
	check if the cell type specific TFBS are more enriched at cell type specific SE

f3b_pairwise_CellType_specific_peak_cor_SE
	for cell type pairs
	check the cell type specific TFBS cor SE

f4_peak_enrich_at_SE_cor_IDR
	check the TFBS distribution within a same cell type
	if TFs enriched at SEs have more potential to have IDR
	
f5_TCGA_ATAC_cor_SE
	check ATAC-seq signal at SE ~ clinical results
	
f6_revised_TCGA_ATAC_cor_SE
	same results as in f5 but to use non-basal BRCA
	
	

fx_chromatin_IDR_by_TFBS  
	Assign IDR to TFBS, use any model to sum the IDR score  
	if mutation at TF gene affect sequence/chromatin IDR potential
fx_DL_NLP_on_chromatin_IDR
	If DL NLP model in NM paper help?
