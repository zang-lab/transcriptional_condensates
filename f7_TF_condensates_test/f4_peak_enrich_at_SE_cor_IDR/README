f1_TFBS_enrich_at_SE
	for each celltype, check the TFBS enrichment at cell type specific SE
	only use the peak file with the largest number of peaks
	use the shuffled genome regions, randomly selected UDHS, randomly selected merged TF peaks as control
	○ for each celltype, check the TFBS enrichment at cell type specific SE
	○ only use the peak file with the largest number of peaks
	○ Background control:
		§ shuffled genome regions, 
		§ randomly selected UDHS, 
		§ randomly selected merged TF peaks
			□ For each factor, merge all peaks from all ChIP-seq data w/ PeaksFoldChangeAbove10 > 200
			□ For hm with large amount of chip-seq peak files, random select 1000 files to merge peaks
