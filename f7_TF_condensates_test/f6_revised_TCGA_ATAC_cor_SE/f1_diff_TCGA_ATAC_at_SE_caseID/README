2. for each cancer type in TCGA, get the differential ATAC-seq score comparing
- patient samples from corresponding cancer type
- patient samples from all other cancers
ATAC-seq score as t-ststistics

3. for each TCGA cancer type with matched SE data, 
get the TCGA ATAC peaks that overlap and NOT overlap with SE data

4. plot the figs compare diff atac-seq score

5. rank all union ATAC-seq regions by differential score for BART analysis

5. rank all union-SE-overlapped ATAC-seq regions by differential score for BART analysis
