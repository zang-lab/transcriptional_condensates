f1_clinical_at_each_peak	
	for each SE overlapped ATAC-seq peak, 
	sep patients by ATAC-seq signal and check survival diff.

--
f2_clinical_at_SE_glmnet
	use Glmnet to select SEs overlapped peaks that are highly associated with clinical results
--	

f2_binding_enrich_TF3490
	for those clinical hicor ATAC-seq regions that overlapped with SE
	check the TF binding -- use previously database from 3490 TF ChIP-seq data
