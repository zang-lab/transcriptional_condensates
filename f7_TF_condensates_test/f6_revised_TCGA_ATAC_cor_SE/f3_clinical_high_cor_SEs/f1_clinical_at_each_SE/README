1. for each TCGA cancer type with matched SE data, 
get the TCGA ATAC peaks that overlap with SE data


2. for each ATAC-seq peak, 
rank patients by ATAC-seq signal and check survival differences


3. get those clinical high-cor, SE overlapped ATAC-seq peaks for BART analysis
4. get all SE overlapped ATAC-seq peaks for BART analysis, ranked by -log(survuval pvalue)
-- the question would be that for 3&4, too few input regions for BART analysis
-- the feature should be more correlated with SEs, and the clinical cor-info could not be fully used
