data
	SE data
	TCGA data
	- TCGA ATAC-seq and clinical data
	- for the ATAC-seq count matrix:
	-- mynorm_xx.txt, each column is a individual techinical rep (published data in paper)
	-- mynorm_xx.caseID.avg.txt, each column is a patient w/ averaged signal across all reps

f1_diff_TCGA_ATAC_at_SE_caseID
    use ATAC-seq count matrix for each patient sample
	check the differential TCGA ATAC-seq signals comparing
	- patient replicates from target cancer type vs.
	- patient replicates from all other cancer types
	then compare the differential TCGA ATAC-seq signals at 
	- SE overlapped ATAC-seq peaks and
	- SE NOT overlapped ATAC-seq peaks  

f2_clinical_hicor_atac_peaks
	for each ATAC-seq peak, do survival analysis
	rank all peaks by clinical results and do BART analysis	
	
f3_clinical_hicor_SE_overlapped_peaks
	for each SE overlapped ATAC-seq peak, do survival analysis
	rank all peaks by clinical results and do BART analysis	

-- NOTES -- 	
f2, clinical hicor regions more enriched at SEs??
f3, BART analysis more reveal SE features rather than clinical feature??
-----------


f4_clinical_hicor_SEs
	find SEs that are highly associated with clinical results
	- clinical results by averaged ATAC-seq signal at each SE
	- clinical results by selected SEs using Glmnet

	
f5_clinical_per_gene
	clinical results by fpkm-uq per gene
