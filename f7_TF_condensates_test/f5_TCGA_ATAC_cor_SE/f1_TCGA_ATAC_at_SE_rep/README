1. get TCGA ATAC peaks/regions that overlapped with merged/all SE

2. for each cancer type in TCGA, get the differential ATAC-seq score comparing
- patient replicates from corresponding cancer type
- patient replicates from all other cancers
ATAC-seq score as t-ststistics

3. for each TCGA cancer type with matched SE data, 
get the TCGA ATAC peaks that overlap and NOT overlap with SE data

4. plot the figs compare diff atac-seq score
