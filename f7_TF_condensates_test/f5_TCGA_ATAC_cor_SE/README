data
	SE data
	
data_TCGA
	TCGA ATAC-seq and clinical data
	for the ATAC-seq count matrix:
	- mynorm_xx.txt, each column is a individual techinical rep (published data in paper)
	- mynorm_xx.caseID.avg.txt, each column is a patient w/ averaged signal across all reps

f1_TCGA_ATAC_at_SE_rep
    use ATAC-seq count matrix for each patient technical rep
	check the differential TCGA ATAC-seq signals comparing
	- patient replicates from target cancer type vs.
	- patient replicates from all other cancer types
	then compare the differential TCGA ATAC-seq signals at 
	- SE overlapped ATAC-seq peaks and
	- SE NOT overlapped ATAC-seq peaks  
	
f1b_TCGA_ATAC_at_SE_caseID -- to do 
	use ATAC-seq count matrix for each patient sample
	
f2_TCGA_ATAC_at_SE_cor_survival
	check the clinical outcomes of patients separated by 
	- averaged ATAC-seq signals at SEs or 
	- SE enriched TF ChIP-seq weighted ATAC-seq signals at SEs  

f3_clinical_high_cor_SEs
	find SEs that are highly associated with clinical results
	- clinical results by ATAC-seq signal at each SE
	- clinical results by selected SEs using Glmnet
	
	
f4_TF_at_clinical_high_cor_SEs
	check the TRs that are enriched at clinical high-cor SEs
	wait to revise the TCGA BRCA and COAD samples
	- check the overlap between the ATAC-seq peaks that overlap
	- cancer specific gained CTCF and SEs
