f1_diff_ATAC_overlap_SE  
	differential ATAC-seq score comparing each cancer type vs. others
	if ATAC-seq peaks overlapped with cell type matched SE have higher differential score


f2_ATAC_RP_clinical 
	get target gene of each factor (RP>1 from SE/TFMS overlapped peaks)
	check clinical outcome of target genes
	
	
f3_all_patient_expression_clinical
	NOTES: USE ALL TCGA patients w/ RNA-seq + clinical data, w/ or w/o ATAC-seq data
	for selected TFs with 
	- high TFBS CP and 
	- higher % of clinical associated target genes
	check if any correlation between 
	- expression of target genes, and 
	- clinical outcome 
	
	
f4_RP_from_ATAC_bigwig_cor_Clinical
	RP using ATAC-seq bigwig file, focusing on regions
	- all ATAC-seq peaks, and 
	- merge of top CP-TFBS with distance < percentile-5 of TFMS
	- and co-binding of multiple TFBS with high CP
