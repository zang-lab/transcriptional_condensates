f1_gene_fpkm-uq_clinical_by_TFRP_topCP
	for TFs with high TFBS CP, do survival analysis, and get
	% of target genes that are highly correlated with clinical outcome
	
	
f2_clinical_gene_vs_peak_gene
	for each TF, do survival analysis, and get 
	% of target genes, vs.
	% of SE and TFMS overlapped ATAC-seq peaks 
	that are highly correlated with clinical outcome
	
f2_clinical_gene_vs_peak_gene_treatLTcontrol
	only focus those with treatment-time < control time 
	when do the survival analysis
