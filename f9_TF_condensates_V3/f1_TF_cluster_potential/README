==
f0_bedtools_closest  
==
get the closest neighbor (down-stream only) for CP analysis for 
- all TF motifs
- all ChIP-seq peaks 
- all motif overlapped peaks
- all motif non-overlapped peaks
the closest neighbor is re-calculated when use TFBS vs. randomly selected TFMS as control


==
f1_TFMS_TFBS_CP
==
CP of TFMS vs randomly generated regions as control, which follow the exponential distribution 

CP of TFBS, using TFMS as control
- to check if TF CP changed compared to TFMS
- and how is this correlated with enrichment at SE


==
f2_cor_CP_SE_AICAP
==
Correlation among
- TF cluster potential
- TF enrichment at SEs
- TF protein AICAP score


==
f3_clustered_TFBS
==
merge all TFBS with closest neighbor < percentile-1 in randomly selected TFMS
check co-occurrence of union binding of TFs with 
- high TFBS CP and 
- high z-scored TFBS CP
