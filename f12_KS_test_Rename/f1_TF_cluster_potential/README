- All results generated using data w/ #peaks >2k, foldChange10 peaks>500
- archive, old version using data w/ motif AND SE
- updated version using data w/ motif, especially for CP vs. AICAP

==
CP of TFMS vs randomly generated regions as control, which follow the exponential distribution 

CP of TFBS, using TFMS as control
- to check if TF CP changed compared to TFMS
- and how is this correlated with enrichment at SE


==
f2_cor_CP_SE_AICAP
==
Correlation among
- TF cluster potential
- TF enrichment at SEs
- TF protein AICAP score


==
f3_clustered_TFBS
==
merge all TFBS with closest neighbor < percentile-1 in randomly selected TFMS
check co-occurrence of union binding of TFs with 
- high TFBS CP and 
- high z-scored TFBS CP 


==
f4_clustered_TFBS_cor_CTCF
==
check the CTCF specificity and CTCF gain potential of  
- high TFBS CP and 
- high z-scored TFBS CP
