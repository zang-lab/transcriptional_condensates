f1_diff_ATAC
	differential ATAC-seq score comparing each cancer type vs. others
	compr. diff. ATAC-seq score between
	- clustered TFBS
	- non-clustered TFBS


f2_RP_from_bigwig
	RP using ATAC-seq bigwig file, focusing on regions
	compr. RP between 
	- clustered TFBS
	- non-clustered TFBS


f4_ATAC_RP_targets_clinical 
	get target gene of each factor (RP>1 from SE/TFMS overlapped peaks)
	check clinical outcome of target genes

	TF target genes: genes with RP>1 using ATAC-seq peaks overlapped with SE and TFMS
	CoTarget ≥ x: target genes for at least x factors.
	Univariate survival analysis of each gene using 
	- FPKM-uq ( [RMg * 10^9 ] / [RM75 * L]) from TCGA.
	- RP from SE overlaped ATAC-seq


fz_combi_figs
	combine data of ATAC-seq RP, differential RP, SE enrichment and DCI
